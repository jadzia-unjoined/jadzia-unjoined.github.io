<p><em>What I’ll hide about me</em>: My actual identity as I believe it would prevent me from being able to express myself.</p>

<p><em>What I’ll write about</em>: My experience working in tech. The good, the bad and the really bad. I’ll likely share fun factoids I find interesting every now and then. And I may use this to talk about other hobbies.</p>
