Hi! Call me Jadzia.

*What to know about me*: I am a female software engineer as one of the big5 tech companies. I really like Star Trek, hence the name. And keep myself busy with a multitude of hobbies.

*What I'll hide about me*: My actual identity as I believe it would prevent me from being able to express myself.

*What I'll write about*: My experience working in tech. The good, the bad and the really bad. I'll likely share fun factoids I find interesting every now and then. And I may use this to talk about other hobbies.
